# Contributing to daiquiri

## Reporting issues

Please report any bugs or suggestions by opening a [github issue](https://github.com/phuongquan/daiquiri/issues).


## Development guidelines

So far, daiquiri has been developed by a single person so there is not yet a system in place for collaboration.
If you'd like to contribute changes please raise an issue first and then we can probably use [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).


## Code of Conduct

Please keep any comments respectful and relevant.
